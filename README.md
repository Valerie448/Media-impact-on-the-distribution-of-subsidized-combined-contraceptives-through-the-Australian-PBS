Oral contraceptives are commonly used by women to prevent unintended pregnancies and manage specific health issues (dysphoric disorder, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis). In May 2015, a study revealed that combined oral contraceptives, which contain both oestrogen and progestogen, might increase the risk of developing blood clots, including serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. This report aims to investigate whether the attention the study received in the media had any impact on the distribution of subsidized combined contraceptives through the Australian PBS.

The research data, available in contraceptives.csv, covers the time from January 2013 to December 2016. The dataset includes date, monthly counts for combined oral contraceptives and progestogen-only contraceptives. The upcoming sections will utilize time series analysis methods and visualizations to explore the raw data, identify any seasonal patterns, assess autocorrelation and delayed effects through statistical tests, establish variables to model changes post-media attention, employ regression models to analyze alterations in dispensing of combined oral contraceptives, plot the predicted counterfactual to visualize predicted changes, use a "control" series (dispensing of progestogen-only oral contraceptives) and discuss outcome.
